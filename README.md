# GCode Diff

A small utility to display and compare slicer settings between two or more .gcode or .ini files generated by PrusaSlicer. Currently only
runs on Windows.

### Installation
Download and run the installer from [here](https://github.com/magnushacker/gcodediff/releases).

### Usage
Use the File->Open command to open a file. If the file is a .gcode file, one column will be added to the display. If the file is a .ini file it is assumed to contain a config bundle and all profiles found in the file will be added as separate columns.

There are two options in the Options menu:
* __Hide identical__: when enabled, all rows where all columns have the same value are hidden. This makes it easy to quickly visualize
differences between files.
* __Hide single values__: when enabled, all rows where only only column have a value are hidden. These rows are not so interesting if you only want to compare two files.

If the files change on disk, hit F5 to refresh.
